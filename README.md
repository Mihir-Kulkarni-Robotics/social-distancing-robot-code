# social-distancing-robot-code

The code in the repository takes input from the Ultrasonic sensor and converts the 
time into distance travelled. 
It then checks the distance value and, depending on the value, starts the Social-Distancing
system or dispenses sanitiser.

Micro-controller Used:
Arduino Genuino Uno
